The Pizza Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2015. So that, the owner of the Pizza store can understand its customers and increase sales in 2016 and 2017.

## Dataset Used
• <a href="https://github.com/alinasingh/Python_projects/blob/main/Pizza_analysis/pizza_sales11.csv">Dateset</a>

## Questions(KPIs)
- Which months got the highest sales?
- List the top 3 Pizza names according to sales.
- Who is the pizza sales category with the most sales?
- What is the total price of each pizza name?
- What is the sum of quantity and sales by pizza_catogory?

## Process in Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python is an essential step in understanding the structure and characteristics of a dataset before applying machine learning or statistical analysis.
This project involves using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize data from Pizza, focusing on • category, total price, Sales, quantity, and so on.

## Process in Power BI
- ETL step for understanding the data structure.
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean concerning data type and values used.
- Worked on several charts, including a clustered bar chart, line chart, clustered column chart, and funnel chart. I am also using a slicer to filter and improve understanding.

## Final Conclusion:
In conclusion, to enhance pizza store sales, a strategic marketing plan should prioritize the Classic and Supreme categories, focusing on increasing the quantity of large pizzas. Additionally, special attention should be given to Thai Chicken Pizza, Barbecue Chicken Pizza, and California Chicken Pizza, as they were the top-selling pizzas in 2015. Strengthening promotions and optimizing production for these popular items will drive growth and improve overall sales performance.
